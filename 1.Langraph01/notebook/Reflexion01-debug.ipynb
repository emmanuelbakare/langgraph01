[...] AI tools are being used in businesses to speed up efficiencies and create smarter workflows. However, we are seeing that many businesses are implementing AI without going through the necessary legal procedures they would normally follow for other technologies. This lack of proper legal processes is a challenge as it opens data concerns and confidentiality issues. For example, AI solutions being used without the proper data protection assessments or confidential data becoming public.
